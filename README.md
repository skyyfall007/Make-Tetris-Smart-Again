# Make-Tetris-Smart-Again

Undergraduate capstone project developed with the objective of presenting an applied theories of reinforcement learning and machine learning via the game of Tetris. Completion of project allowed for the better understanding of machine learning concepts from an undergraduate perspective and the possible advancements that can be explored by doing so.

#### `` tetris.py `` 
An open source tetris implimentation that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/silvasur/565419). It willbe the implimentation that we will use to integrate our ML algorithm. It's been modified to be compatible with Python 3.

#### `` q_learning.py `` 
A simple Q-learning implimentation that was made for the purpose of understanding reinforcement learning.

#### `` tetris_q_learnng_prototype.py ``

This is a modified version of  ``tetris.py`` that has been inegrated with the Q-learning training algorithm. For the sake of prototyping, this modified version of tetris has the following modifications:
* A Board size of 3x3 squares
* A single shape piece that is a 1x1 square
