# Make-Tetris-Smart-Again

This project is about using Machine Learning to solve the problem of tetris


### Contents

#### `` tetris.py `` 
An open source tetris implimentation that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/silvasur/565419). It willbe the implimentation that we will use to integrate our ML algorithm. It's been modified to be compatible with Python 3.

#### `` q_learning.py `` 
A simple Q-learning implimentation that was made for the purpose of understanding reinforcement learning.

#### `` tetris_q_learnng_prototype.py ``

This is a modified version of  ``tetris.py`` that has been inegrated with the Q-learning training algorithm. For the sake of prototyping, this modified version of tetris has the following modifications:
* A Board size of 3x3 squares
* A single shape piece that is a 1x1 square
